# PublicAI Pulse

PublicAI Pulse is a browser-based simulation that lets users explore how AI governance decisions—like transparency and bias—affect the delivery of public services. It demonstrates, in real time, how such parameters can impact outcomes like healthcare access and transit fairness.

## Features

- Interactive sliders to control transparency and bias
- Real-time simulation of public service outcomes
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Lightweight and runs directly in the browser

## How It Works

This simulation uses basic rule-based logic. For example, increasing transparency while reducing bias improves public outcomes. The goal is to help users think critically about how AI systems can govern public services.
